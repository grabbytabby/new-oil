They’ll give you a clearer picture than any other diagram about the connections between the various features in your data.

3. ALWAYS SAVE YOUR MODELS
Saving your models will save you from the headache of repeatedly training your models whenever you’re given new data.

It’s a great boon to save your models if your machine ever crashes. With your models saved, you don’t have to go through the agony of waiting for them to train over and over again. You can simply load them from your directory.

I made the rookie mistake of not saving my models when I did my first machine learning project. I cycled through at least 20 of them with varying parameters, and had to retrain them if my kernel ever crashed.

3 Great Python Libraries to Save and Load Machine Learning/Deep Learning Models Include:

joblib
pickle
built-in ‘model.save’ command in tensorflow
Saving your machine learning models can save time when you’re trying out different methods
Sample model.save command I used to save a basic Bi-Directional LSTM Model
4. Don’t Be Afraid to Experiment With Different Libraries
Different tools are good for different applications. You don’t have to stick to what you’re taught for every data problem.

That’s why it’s important to experiment with as many python libraries as you can.

To give you an example; my preferred library to performing deep learning tasks is Tensorflow. However, there are several other libraries out there to perform deep learning tasks including PyTorch, Caffe, and H2O.

Another example I can quote from experience is using the Sklearn library to train machine learning models. It’s a very comprehensive library to carry out all sorts of data analysis tasks including feature selection, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning.

However, when I discovered PyCaret, there was just no going back.

PyCaret is a very useful library to cycle through machine learning models
PyCaret runs through several machine learning methods to pick out the best model for your data
PyCaret cycles through all the basic supervised machine learning methods using whatever parameters you set with just one line of code. It also picks out the best model generated based on your preferred metric and allows you to tune it.

PyCaret extracts the most important features from your machine learning models
PyCaret shows you the most important features in your model by generating a “feature importance plot”
So, let that be a lesson to budding data scientists out there. Don’t be afraid to experiment with new libraries. It may seem daunting, but you may end up learning a new method that is more optimal for your needs.

There is a lot more to learn in your data science career than these tips of course, but nevertheless, they’ll make it just a little easier to solve even the most gargantuan problems you will face.
